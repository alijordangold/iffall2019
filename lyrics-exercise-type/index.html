				<h2> Sung by Elton John, <br> Written by Bernie Taupin  </h2>

				<p class="verse"> <em>[Verse 1]</em> <br>
					Blue jean baby, L.A. lady <br>
					Seamstress for the band<br>
					Pretty-eyed, pirate smile<br>
					You'll marry a music man<br>
					Ballerina, you must've seen her<br>
					Dancing in the sand<br>
					And now she's in me, always with me<br>
					Tiny dancer in my hand<br>
				</p>

				<p class="verse"> <em>[Verse 2]</em> <br>
					Jesus freaks out in the street<br>
					Handing tickets out for God<br>
					Turning back, she just laughs<br>
					The boulevard is not that bad<br>
					Piano man, he makes his stand<br>
					In the auditorium<br>
					Looking on, she sings the songs<br>
					The words she knows, the tune she hums<br>
				</p>

				<p class="pre"><em>[Pre-Chorus]</em><br>
					But, oh, how it feels so real<br>
					Lying here with no one near<br>
					Only you, and you can hear me<br>
					When I say softly, slowly<br>
				</p>

				<p class="chorus"><em>[Chorus]</em><br>
					Hold me closer, tiny dancer<br>
					Count the headlights on the highway<br>
					Lay me down in sheets of linen<br>
					You had a busy day today<br>
					Hold me closer, tiny dancer<br>
					Count the headlights on the highway<br>
					Lay me down in sheets of linen<br>
					You had a busy day today<br>
				</p>
