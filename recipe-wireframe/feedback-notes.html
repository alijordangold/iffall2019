Wireframe feedback from Brooke

-	Reorganize the type so it's not just a bold - not bold pattern - this can be jarring and not really helpful.
<br>
-	Put the current design into one column, this is more mobile friendly and much easier to build.
<br>
-	It might be easier to just insert a singular photo where the line of blueberries currently is.
<br>
-	Experiment with potentially using a less loopy font for the headlines.
<br>
-   The current color scheme is good.
<br>
-	Is the gallery necessary? It could be more user-friendly to include step-by-step pictures along the way instead.
