		<p>Yang Yoseob, more commonly known as Yoseob, is a South Korean singer and musical actor. He is the main vocalist of the boy group <b>Highlight </b>. Yoseob was born in Seoul, South Korea on January 5, 1990. He first gained interest in music and singing after listening to R&B musician Brian McKnight. He then listened to a lot of music of a similar style, but realized that he should not be biased towards a certain genre, and started listening to dance music and rock as well. When he was in high school, he joined a school band where he performed a lot of hard rock and metal. Yoseob wanted to try modern rock, though his mentors criticized this aspiration. </p>

		<p>Yoseob became a JYP Entertainment trainee, but left after receiving a bad grade from practice reviews. He moved agencies, to M Boat Entertainment (a former sister company of YG Entertainment) where he was trained for five years before transferring to Cube Entertainment where he became a member of <b>Beast</b>, a boyband later renamed <b>Highlight</b>.</p>

		<p>Yoseob has also had a successful solo career, has performed in numerous musicals beginning in 2011, served as a judge on a popular Korean music reality show, and acted in several television series. Yoseob attended Dong-ah Institute of Media and Arts, formerly known as Dong-Ah Broadcasting College, and graduated in 2014. He began his mandatory military service on January 25, 2019. </p>

		<h1>BOYBAND</h1>

		<div id="caption"> <img src="images/highlight.jpg"> <p>Yoseob is the main vocalist of Beast. The group has released two studio albums, eight Korean EPs and various singles.</p> </div>

		<p><b>Highlight (Korean: 하이라이트)</b> is a South Korean boy band formerly known as <b>Beast</b> (Korean: 비스트). The band consists of four members: Yoon Doo-joon, Yang Yo-seob, Lee Gi-kwang, and Son Dong-woon. Original member Jang Hyun-seung officially left the group in April 2016, and Yong Jun-hyung left in March 2019. In late 2016, the group moved labels from Cube Entertainment to Around Us Entertainment and subsequently changed their name to <b>Highlight</b> in 2017. As <b>Beast</b>, the group released three Korean full-length albums, nine Korean mini-albums, two Japanese full-length albums, and numerous singles. The group debuted in 2009 with the mini-album, <i>Beast Is the B2ST</i>. In 2011, they released their first full-length album, <i>Fiction and Fact</i>. As <b>Highlight</b>, the group debuted in 2017 with the mini-album, <i>Can You Feel It?</i>.</p>
		
		<p><b>Beast</b> initially received attention for the lack of industry success previously experienced by its members, with media outlets referring to them as "a group of recycled material." However, they have achieved significant success and critical accolades as one of the most awarded groups of all time at the Golden Disk Awards, the Seoul Music Awards, and the Melon Music Awards.</p>
